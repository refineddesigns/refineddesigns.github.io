our initial meeting! Not only were we pleased with this level of service but the display album of 
sample invites were stunning and so elegant! <br>

Sebastian and I asked Simone to put together a sample invite for us in our colour scheme/ 
selected style and again we were so pleased with the level of service we received, so 
professional, and the quality of our sample wedding invite! It was just gorgeous, exactly what 
we wanted!!!<br>

We later had Simone make our table menus and the guest name tags which again was 
perfect!!!<br>
