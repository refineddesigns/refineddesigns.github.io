                        "My now husband and I met with Simone from Refined Designs to discuss stationery for our special day; our wedding. Simone was very happy to come meet Sebastian and I at our house at a time that was convenient for all.

                        Sebastian and I were extremely pleased with how prepared and attentive Simone was during our initial meeting! Not only were we pleased with this level of service but the display album of sample invites were stunning and so elegant!

                        Sebastian and I asked Simone to put together a sample invite for us in our colour scheme/ selected style and again we were so pleased with the level of service we received, so professional, and the quality of our sample wedding invite! It was just gorgeous, exactly what we wanted!!!

                        We later had Simone make our table menus and the guest name tags which again was perfect!!!

                        Sebastian and I have no hesitation in recommending Simone from Refined Designs due to excellence in service, quality stationery, reasonable prices and all completed in a timely manner!!" - renee & sebastian c
